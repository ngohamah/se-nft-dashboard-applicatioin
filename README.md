# se-nft-dashboard-applicatioin

In this Software Engineering final project, we build an nft dashboard that can be used to track the performance of various nft collections. Some 
additional tools we used include firebase for our backend and NewsAPI for collating latest news on nfts.

A profound thing about our application is that it can be used to track the weekly tweet participation for an nft collection hence can reveal which nfts are 
more popular than others. Our application can also be used to compare different ntf collections based on month-over-month floor price. We integrated the NewsAPI
feature to capture and display latest nft news. 

One of the main goals of this project was introducing the idea of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the Ghanaian ecosystem and using it to educate 
Ghanaian artist to explore NFTs as a way of publicizing their work to a larger audience. Further development could uncover significant areas for growth.
